# ToDo

This app allows users to track a ToDo list.  
It uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore NoSQL storage solutions for storing, updating, and fetching user data.  
The app was built using Flutter Flow for mobile/web app development, powered by Dart-lang and Flutter libraries.  
This app was built for Wk. 3 Homework Assignment for URI CSC305, and loosely followed a tutorial from the Flutter Flow devs.
